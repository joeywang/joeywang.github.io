# Setting Up k3s: A Comprehensive Guide with Troubleshooting

## 1. What is k3s?

k3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, remote locations. It is a fully compliant Kubernetes runtime that is easier to install and manage than other Kubernetes distributions. k3s is optimized for running in resource-constrained environments, such as edge computing setups or IoT devices, but it is also suitable for traditional cloud environments.

## 2. How to Install k3s on Ubuntu

To install k3s on an Ubuntu system, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:
- Ubuntu 18.04 or later
- 2 GB RAM
- 2 CPUs
- 20 GB disk space
- Internet connectivity

### Installation Steps

1. **Update System Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Download k3s:**
   ```bash
   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION="v1.23.3+k3s1" sh -
   ```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status k3s
   ```

4. **Configure k3s Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable k3s
   ```

## 3. How to Run k3s

Once k3s is installed, it runs as a service. However, you can manually start, stop, or restart k3s using the following commands:

- **Start k3s:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start k3s
  ```

- **Stop k3s:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop k3s
  ```

- **Restart k3s:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart k3s
  ```

## 4. How to Connect with kubectl

To manage your k3s cluster, you need to use `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line tool. Here's how to set it up:

### Configure kubectl

1. **Set KUBECONFIG Environment Variable:**
   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
   ```

2. **Check Cluster Status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)"

If you encounter the error "You must be logged in to the server (Unauthorized)" when trying to run `kubectl get pods -A`, it usually means that your `kubectl` client is not properly configured to connect to the k3s cluster.

**Solution:**

1. **Copy k3s.yaml to Client Host:**
   Ensure that you have copied the `k3s.yaml` from the host running k3s to your client host's `~/.kube/config` directory.
   ```bash
   scp root@k3s-host:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
   ```

2. **Set KUBECONFIG Environment Variable:**
   Make sure the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is set correctly.
   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
   ```

3. **Check Certificate Expiry:**
   Use the following command to check if the certificate has expired:
   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect localhost:6443 -showcerts < /dev/null 2>&1 | openssl x509 -noout -enddate
   ```
   If the certificate has expired, you will need to regenerate it and update the `k3s.yaml` file accordingly.

### Conclusion

k3s is a powerful tool for running Kubernetes in resource-constrained environments. By following the steps above, you can set up k3s on Ubuntu, run it, and manage it using `kubectl`. If you encounter any issues, the troubleshooting tips provided should help you resolve common problems.
