# Deep Dive into Ruby Internals: From Rails Caching to C-Level Object IDs

When debugging Rails applications, sometimes we stumble upon fascinating aspects of Ruby's internal workings. This article shares a journey that started with a simple Rails caching issue and led us deep into Ruby's object model and memory management system.

## The Starting Point: Rails Caching and Kaminari

It all began with what seemed like a straightforward Rails caching operation:

```ruby
Rails.cache.write(Lesson.page(1))
```

This line threw an unexpected error. We were using Kaminari for pagination, and something wasn't quite right. The error message was cryptic:

```ruby
TypeError: can't dump anonymous module #<Module:0x000000012028d860>
```

## Understanding Anonymous Modules

To understand what was happening, let's first look at how anonymous modules are typically created in Ruby:

```ruby
# Creating an anonymous module
dynamic_module = Module.new do
  def some_method
    "Hello from anonymous module"
  end
end

# Using the anonymous module
class MyClass
  include dynamic_module
end
```

Anonymous modules are commonly used for:
- Creating dynamic mixins
- Implementing plugin systems
- Metaprogramming scenarios

However, they come with certain limitations, particularly when it comes to serialization.

## Debugging with Ruby's Built-in Debugger (rdbg)

To investigate further, we used Ruby's built-in debugger:

```ruby
require 'debug'

# Set a breakpoint to catch the TypeError
catch TypeError do
  Rails.cache.write(Lesson.page(1))
end
```

When the error occurred, we were inside the debugger and tried to inspect the module:

```ruby
(rdbg) p self
#<Module:0x000000012028d860>
```

Attempting to find the source code or definition of this module led to an interesting discovery - there was none! The module was created at the C level, which explained why we couldn't access its Ruby source code.

## Marshal's Restrictions

The error came from Marshal, Ruby's built-in serialization system. Marshal has specific restrictions, one of which is the inability to dump anonymous modules. Here's why:

```ruby
# This works fine
Marshal.dump(String)

# This raises TypeError
anonymous_module = Module.new
Marshal.dump(anonymous_module)  # TypeError: can't dump anonymous module
```

This restriction exists because:
1. Anonymous modules lack persistent names
2. They might contain context-dependent behavior
3. Their state might be tied to the current runtime

## Digging Deeper: Module Inspection

When debugging modules (named or anonymous), we can gather information using various Ruby methods:

```ruby
module SomeModule
  def self.some_method; end
end

# Basic inspection
p SomeModule.name                    # "SomeModule"
p SomeModule.instance_methods(false) # [:some_method]
p SomeModule.ancestors              # [SomeModule, Object, Kernel, BasicObject]

# For anonymous modules
anonymous_mod = Module.new
p anonymous_mod.name                 # nil
p anonymous_mod.object_id            # Some number like 8980
```

## The Connection: Ruby Object IDs and C-Level Memory Addresses

During our investigation, we discovered an interesting relationship between Ruby's object IDs and C-level memory addresses:

```ruby
# In debugger:
(rdbg) self
#<Module:0x000000012029fb50>
(rdbg) object_id
8980
```

The connection between these identifiers reveals how Ruby manages objects internally:

1. The hex address (0x000000012029fb50) is the actual memory location in C
2. The object_id (8980) is Ruby's internal object identifier
3. There's a mathematical relationship between them: `object_id * 2` approximates the memory address

Here's how we can work with these IDs:

```ruby
# Getting object from Ruby object_id
obj = ObjectSpace._id2ref(8980)

# Getting hex representation of object_id
hex_addr = "0x%016x" % (obj.object_id * 2)

# For immediate values (small integers, symbols, etc.)
num = 42
p num.object_id      # Will be 85 (42 * 2 + 1)
```

## Ruby's Object Model Under the Hood

This investigation reveals several important aspects of Ruby's object model:

1. Object Tagging System:
   - Regular objects have even-numbered object_ids
   - Immediate values (small integers, symbols) have special representations
   - The lowest bits are used for type tagging

2. Memory Layout:
```plaintext
Regular Objects:
[  klass  |  flags  |  instance variables  ]
    ^
    |
  object_id * 2 points approximately here

Immediate Values:
[   value   | tag bits ]
```

3. Garbage Collection Considerations:
```ruby
require 'objspace'

# Track object allocation
ObjectSpace.trace_object_allocations do
  obj = Object.new
  p ObjectSpace.allocation_sourcefile(obj)
  p ObjectSpace.allocation_sourceline(obj)
end
```

## Practical Implications

This deep dive has several practical implications for Ruby developers:

1. Caching Considerations:
   - Be careful when caching objects that might contain anonymous modules
   - Consider implementing custom serialization for such cases

2. Debugging Strategies:
   - Use `object_id` and hex addresses to track objects across contexts
   - Understand when you're dealing with C-level vs. Ruby-level code

3. Memory Management:
   - Awareness of how Ruby manages object identity
   - Understanding of immediate values vs. regular objects

## Conclusion

What started as a simple Rails caching issue led us through a fascinating journey into Ruby's internals. We learned about:
- Anonymous modules and their limitations
- Ruby's debugging capabilities
- Marshal serialization restrictions
- Object identity and memory management
- The connection between Ruby's object model and C-level implementation

This kind of deep understanding can be invaluable when debugging complex issues or optimizing Ruby applications. It reminds us that even seemingly simple operations can have complex underpinnings worth understanding.

## Further Reading

- Ruby's source code, particularly the implementation of `object_id` and Marshal
- Ruby's garbage collector implementation
- Ruby's object model documentation
- Rails caching strategies and limitations

Remember that while this level of detail isn't necessary for day-to-day Ruby development, understanding these internals can help you make better decisions when designing systems and debugging complex issues.
