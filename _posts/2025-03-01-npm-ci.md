## 🛠 Why `npm ci` Runs `prepare` for Dependencies — And How I Fixed My Husky Hook Nightmare

When running `npm ci` in CI/CD environments, you'd expect it to be a clean, script-free install based on your lockfile. But to my surprise, it was running `prepare` scripts — not just for my project, but also for dependencies. This caused a mysterious failure, and in my case, it was due to **Husky** trying to install Git hooks... inside a Git repo dependency.

Let's break down the **why**, the **gotchas**, and the **fix**.

---

### 🤯 The Problem: `npm ci` Runs `prepare` for Git Dependencies

You might assume `npm ci` is a strict, minimal install — kind of like `yarn --frozen-lockfile`. But in reality, npm **still runs lifecycle scripts** under the hood, including `prepare`, and not just for your own project.

The key culprit is the [`prepare` lifecycle script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/scripts#prepare), which runs when:

- You install a package from a **Git URL** or local file path
- You do `npm link`
- You install your **own** project
- You install a dependency from Git (and **this always happens in CI** if such dependencies exist)

> **What it does:** `prepare` is used to build/transpile the package after it’s cloned — think of creating the `dist/` folder.

---

### 😵 My Case: Husky Failing to Install in a Git Dependency

I had a monorepo setup where a package depended on another internal Git repo. That internal repo had Husky installed, and its `prepare` script looked like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "husky install"
}
```

So when `npm ci` ran in my CI job, it pulled the dependency from Git, **triggered `prepare`**, and then **Husky tried to install Git hooks into the Git repo**... which wasn't a real repo in the CI context. It failed hard with:

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

---

### 🔍 Debugging the Problem

At first, I tried:

- `npm ci --skip-prepare` – nope, doesn’t exist.
- `SKIP_PREPARE=1` – no effect.
- Adding `postinstall` instead of `prepare` – also runs, but not the root cause.
- Disabling scripts entirely:  
  ```bash
  npm_config_ignore_scripts=true
  ```  
  This worked but broke everything else (like legitimate postinstall scripts).

### ✅ The Fix: Condition Husky Install to Only Run in the Main Repo

I realized the solution wasn’t to stop `npm` from running `prepare` globally — it was to **make Husky smarter**.

Here’s the fix:

**Modify `prepare` to only run `husky install` if it's the main project:**

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "test -d .git && husky install || echo 'Skipping husky install: not a git repo'"
}
```

Or if you're on Windows too, use a JS script in `prepare.js`:

```js
const { execSync } = require('child_process');
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  if (fs.existsSync('.git')) {
    execSync('npx husky install', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  } else {
    console.log('Skipping husky install: not a git repo');
  }
} catch (e) {
  console.error('Failed to run husky install', e);
}
```

Now, Husky only tries to install in environments where `.git` exists — i.e., not in the extracted Git dependency in CI.

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- `npm ci` **does run `prepare` scripts** — even for dependencies — if they're Git-based or file-based.
- You **can’t** skip `prepare` with a flag.
- If you're using Husky or other Git-hook tools in a dependency, **guard it with logic** to avoid running in subrepos or CI environments.

---

### 🏁 Final Tip

To check which scripts are being run during install, use:

```bash
npm install --foreground-scripts
```

This shows you what’s executing, and can help debug mysterious behaviors in CI environments.
