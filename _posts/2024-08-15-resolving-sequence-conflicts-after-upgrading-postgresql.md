# Title: Resolving Sequence Conflicts After Upgrading PostgreSQL

## Introduction

Upgrading a database management system like PostgreSQL is a critical task that often comes with its own set of challenges. One common issue that can arise post-upgrade is the misalignment of sequences, which can lead to significant problems such as blocking user sign-ins. In this article, we will explore the nature of sequence issues, why they occur during an upgrade, and how to effectively resolve them using custom SQL functions and scripts.

## Understanding Sequences in PostgreSQL

Before diving into the solutions, it's important to understand what sequences are and why they're important. In PostgreSQL, a sequence is a database object that generates a sequence of integer values, commonly used for primary key generation. When upgrading PostgreSQL, the sequence values may not synchronize correctly with the new version, leading to conflicts.

## The Problem: Sequence Misalignment Post-Upgrade

When upgrading from PostgreSQL 15 to 16, you might encounter a scenario where sequences do not align with the actual maximum values in the tables they are associated with. This misalignment can cause issues such as duplicate key errors, preventing new records from being inserted and, in some cases, blocking user sign-ins.

## Solution 1: Custom PL/pgSQL Function to Reset Sequences

To address this issue, we can create a PL/pgSQL function that resets sequences to the maximum value of their associated tables. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create the Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION reset_sequences_to_max(schema varchar default 'public', dry_run bool default true)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
    query TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Loop through all tables
    FOR r IN SELECT t.table_schema, t.table_name, column_name, sequence_name
             FROM information_schema.tables t
             JOIN information_schema.columns c ON t.table_name = c.table_name
             JOIN information_schema.sequences s ON 'nextval('''||s.sequence_name||'''::regclass)' = c.column_default
             WHERE t.table_schema = schema
    LOOP
        -- Construct the dynamic query to set the sequence value
        query := format('SELECT setval(''%I'', (SELECT MAX(%I) FROM %I.%I) - 1);',
                         r.sequence_name, r.column_name, r.table_schema, r.table_name);

        -- Execute the dynamic query
        if dry_run then
            raise notice'Run query: %', query;
        else
            EXECUTE query;
        end if;

    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This function loops through all tables within a specified schema, constructs a dynamic SQL query for each sequence, and either executes the query or outputs it for review, depending on the `dry_run` parameter.

### Step 2: Use the Function

You can now call this function for the schema(s) affected by the sequence misalignment:

```sql
SELECT reset_sequences_to_max('public', false); -- Replace 'public' with your schema and set dry_run to false to execute
```

## Solution 2: Bash Script for Bulk Sequence Reset

For a more hands-on approach, especially when dealing with multiple databases, you can use a Bash script to generate and execute SQL commands that reset sequences.

### Step 1: Generate the SQL Script

Create a Bash script that constructs an SQL script with the necessary `SETVAL` commands:

```bash
cat > /tmp/reset.sql << EOL
-- SQL commands to reset sequences
 SELECT
     'SELECT SETVAL(' ||
        quote_literal(quote_ident(sequence_namespace.nspname) || '.' || quote_ident(class_sequence.relname)) ||
        ', COALESCE(MAX(' ||quote_ident(pg_attribute.attname)|| '), 1) ) FROM ' ||
        quote_ident(table_namespace.nspname)|| '.'||quote_ident(class_table.relname)|| ';'
 FROM pg_depend
     INNER JOIN pg_class AS class_sequence
         ON class_sequence.oid = pg_depend.objid
             AND class_sequence.relkind = 'S'
     INNER JOIN pg_class AS class_table
         ON class_table.oid = pg_depend.refobjid
     INNER JOIN pg_attribute
         ON pg_attribute.attrelid = class_table.oid
             AND pg_depend.refobjsubid = pg_attribute.attnum
     INNER JOIN pg_namespace as table_namespace
         ON table_namespace.oid = class_table.relnamespace
     INNER JOIN pg_namespace AS sequence_namespace
         ON sequence_namespace.oid = class_sequence.relnamespace
 ORDER BY sequence_namespace.nspname, class_sequence.relname;
EOL
```

### Step 2: Export and Run the SQL Commands

Loop through your databases and execute the generated SQL script to reset the sequences:

```bash
for db in $databases; do
    psql -Atq -f /tmp/reset.sql -d $db -o /tmp/$db.sql
    psql -f /tmp/$db.sql -d $db
done
```

## Conclusion

Sequence misalignment is a common pitfall when upgrading PostgreSQL. By using the custom PL/pgSQL function or the Bash script provided, you can effectively resolve these issues and ensure that your database operates smoothly post-upgrade. Always remember to back up your database before performing any operations that modify its structure or data.

## Additional Tips

- Always perform upgrades in a test environment before applying them to production.
- Keep your database backups up-to-date to prevent data loss.
- Test the function and script in a non-production environment to ensure they work as expected.
