# Devise Metaprogramming: A Deep Dive into current_user

## 1. What is Devise?

Devise is a flexible authentication solution for Rails based on Warden. It's a full-featured authentication framework that handles everything from encrypting passwords to creating and managing user sessions. Devise is highly modular and configurable, making it a popular choice for Rails developers.

## 2. Metaprogramming in Devise

Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs that write or manipulate other programs (or themselves) as their data. In Ruby, this often involves dynamically defining methods, classes, or modules.

Devise uses metaprogramming extensively to generate methods based on the models you've configured for authentication. This allows Devise to be flexible and adaptable to different application needs without requiring developers to write boilerplate code.

## 3. What is current_user?

`current_user` is a method commonly used in Rails applications to retrieve the currently logged-in user. When using Devise, this method is dynamically generated for each model you've set up for authentication.

For example, if you have a `User` model authenticated with Devise, you'll get a `current_user` method. If you also have an `Admin` model, you'll get a `current_admin` method.

## 4. Debugging Challenges with Devise Metaprogramming

### 4.1 Limitations of byebug

When you try to set a breakpoint in the `current_user` method definition using byebug, you might find that it fails. This is because the method doesn't exist in the way you might expect.

The `current_user` method is generated dynamically by Devise's metaprogramming. The code you see in Devise's source (something like this):

```ruby
# meatprogramming
def #{mapping}_signed_in?
  !!current_#{mapping}
end

def current_#{mapping}
  # mapping value can not be shown here
  # __method__ value will show `current_user`
  @current_#{mapping} ||= warden.authenticate(scope: :#{mapping})
end
```

This is not the actual method definition, but a template used to generate the method. The real method is created at runtime, so the file and line number where you're trying to set the breakpoint don't correspond to the actual method location in memory.

### 4.2 The debug gem: A More Powerful Alternative

Ruby 3.1 introduced the `debug` gem as the new standard debugging library, replacing `byebug`. The `debug` gem offers several advantages when dealing with metaprogramming scenarios:

1. **Dynamic Breakpoints**: Unlike `byebug`, the `debug` gem can set breakpoints on methods that are dynamically defined at runtime.
2. **Remote Debugging**: It supports remote debugging out of the box.
3. **Better REPL**: The `debug` gem provides a more feature-rich REPL for inspecting and manipulating the program state during debugging.
4. **Improved Performance**: It's generally faster than `byebug`, especially for larger codebases.

To use the `debug` gem with Rails, add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'debug', '>= 1.0.0'
```

Then, you can set a breakpoint in your code like this:

```ruby
def some_method
  debugger
  # rest of the method
end
```

Or, you can start the debugger from the command line:

```
rails server --debugger
```

To set a breakpoint on the dynamically generated `current_user` method:

```ruby
debugger.break MyController, :current_user
```

### 4.3 Tradeoffs and Considerations

While the `debug` gem offers powerful features for dealing with metaprogramming, it's worth noting a few considerations:

1. **Learning Curve**: If you're used to `byebug`, there might be a slight learning curve to get familiar with the `debug` gem's commands and features.
2. **Rails Integration**: As of early 2023, some Rails-specific debugging features might not be as seamlessly integrated with the `debug` gem as they were with `byebug`.
3. **Version Compatibility**: The `debug` gem requires Ruby 2.6.0 or later.

## 5. Advanced Debugging Techniques

### 5.1 Debugging with Method Dynamic Replacement and Restoration

To debug the `current_user` method, we can use Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities to dynamically replace the method with a debuggable version, and then restore it when we're done. Here's how:

```ruby
# Get the original method
original_method = method(:current_user)

# Define a new method with debugging
new_method = proc do |*args|
  puts "Entering current_user"
  result = original_method.call(*args)
  puts "Result: #{result.inspect}"
  debugger # or binding.pry
  result
end

# Replace the original method
define_method(:current_user, new_method)

# ... debugging ...

# Restore the original method
define_method(:current_user, original_method)
```

Do it inside of the instance method
with `__method__` you are able to find out the method name.

```ruby
# Assuming we're inside the original current_user method

# Get the current method object
current_method = method(__method__)

# Define the new method
new_method = proc do |*args|
  puts "Entering modified current_user method"
  result = current_method.call(*args)
  puts "current_user result: #{result.inspect}"
  # debugger
  result
end

# Replace the method
self.class.send(:define_method, __method__, new_method)
self.class.send(:define_method, "old_#{__method__}", current_method)

# Restore the old method
old_method = method("old_#{__method__}")
self.class.send(:define_method, __method__, old_method)

self.class.send(:undef_method, "old_#{__method__}")

# Call the new method to continue execution
new_method.call
```

To restore the original method, you can find the one from superclass using `superclass.instance_method`, or you need to keep the old one and restore it later.

### 5.2 Using alias_method for Debugging

Another powerful technique for debugging metaprogrammed methods like `current_user` is using Ruby's `alias_method`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Create an alias for the original method
  alias_method :original_current_user, :current_user

  # Redefine current_user with debugging
  def current_user
    puts "Entering current_user method"
    result = original_current_user
    puts "current_user result: #{result.inspect}"
    debugger # or binding.pry
    result
  end
end
```

### 5.3 Restoring the Original Method

After debugging, restore the original method:

1. **Using alias_method again**:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  alias_method :current_user, :original_current_user
  remove_method :original_current_user
end
```

2. **Using undef_method and define_method**:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  original_method = instance_method(:current_user)
  undef_method :current_user
  define_method :current_user, original_method
end
```

### 5.4 Considerations when using alias_method

1. **Method Visibility**: `alias_method` preserves the method's visibility (public, protected, or private).
2. **Performance**: Using `alias_method` has a very small performance impact.
3. **Inheritance**: If the method is defined in a superclass, `alias_method` in a subclass will only affect the subclass.
4. **Timing**: Set up aliases before any code that might call the method is executed.

## 6. What We've Learned

1. Devise uses metaprogramming to generate methods dynamically, which allows for great flexibility but can make debugging tricky.
2. Methods like `current_user` don't exist in the source code in the way we might expect, which is why traditional breakpoint setting can fail.
3. Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities allow us to dynamically modify and restore methods at runtime, providing powerful debugging techniques.
4. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of libraries like Devise can greatly enhance our ability to work with and debug them effectively.

## 7. Other Methods for Method Replacement and Restoration

Besides the approaches outlined above, other ways to replace and restore methods in Ruby include using `prepend` and `Module#refine`. Here are examples of each:

### 7.1 Using prepend

The `prepend` method allows you to add methods to a class that will be called before the class's own methods. This can be useful for debugging or modifying behavior without changing the original method.

```ruby
module DebuggingModule
  def current_user
    puts "Entering current_user method"
    result = super
    puts "current_user result: #{result.inspect}"
    debugger # or binding.pry
    result
  end
end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  prepend DebuggingModule
end

# To remove the debugging code later:
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  singleton_class.send(:remove_method, :prepend)
  prepend Module.new
end
```

In this example, the `current_user` method in `DebuggingModule` will be called before the original `current_user` method in `ApplicationController`. The `super` call invokes the original method.

### 7.2 Using Module#refine

Refinements allow you to modify classes or modules within a limited scope. This can be useful for debugging in specific contexts without affecting the entire application.

```ruby
module DebuggingRefinements
  refine ApplicationController do
    def current_user
      puts "Entering current_user method"
      result = super
      puts "current_user result: #{result.inspect}"
      debugger # or binding.pry
      result
    end
  end
end

# In the file or context where you want to use the debugging version:
using DebuggingRefinements

# The refined version of current_user will only be active in this file or block
```

Refinements are lexically scoped, meaning they only take effect where you explicitly activate them with `using`. This makes them a safe way to modify behavior in a controlled manner.

Each of these methods (along with `alias_method` and dynamic method replacement) has its own use cases and trade-offs. The choice depends on your specific needs, the scope of changes you want to make, and how permanently you want to modify the method.

- `prepend` is useful when you want to consistently modify behavior across an entire class hierarchy.
- `Module#refine` is beneficial when you need to modify behavior in a very specific, controlled context.
- `alias_method` is handy for quick, reversible modifications.
- Dynamic method replacement using `define_method` offers the most flexibility but requires careful management of the original method.

In conclusion, understanding these metaprogramming techniques in the context of Devise not only helps with debugging but also provides insights into advanced Ruby techniques that can be applied in various scenarios. Each approach offers different levels of scope, permanence, and ease of implementation, allowing you to choose the best tool for your specific debugging or modification needs.
