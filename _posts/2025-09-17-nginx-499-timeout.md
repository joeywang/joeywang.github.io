# 🧱 From 499 to 200: Understanding Puma Worker Timeouts, Nginx 499s, and How to Keep Your Rails API Fast

When you start seeing a spike in **HTTP 499s** in your Nginx logs, it feels mysterious:
> “The client closed the connection before the server responded.”

But a `499` isn’t random. It’s a **warning signal** that your system is slow or unbalanced.  
Let’s unpack the why — and the how to fix it.

---

## ⚙️ Understanding the Stack

A typical Rails + Puma + Nginx stack looks like this:

```

Browser → CDN → Nginx → Puma → Rails → DB / Redis / External API

````

If any layer takes longer than the timeout of the layer above, the client gives up.  
That’s when Nginx logs a `499`.

## 💣 Anatomy of a Slow Request

```ruby
# app/controllers/demo_controller.rb
class DemoController < ApplicationController
  def cpu_heavy
    render json: { result: (1..50_000_000).sum }
  end

  def io_heavy
    render json: { result: Net::HTTP.get(URI('https://httpbin.org/delay/3')) }
  end
end
````

* **CPU-bound**: blocks the Ruby GVL and stalls other threads.
* **I/O-bound**: wastes time waiting for slow dependencies.

## 🩹 Quick Mitigations

### ✅ 1. Align Timeouts (Stop Early Cutoffs)

**Puma** (`config/puma.rb`):

```ruby
workers ENV.fetch("WEB_CONCURRENCY") { 4 }
threads_count = ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 8 }
threads threads_count, threads_count
worker_timeout 60
force_shutdown_after 10
```

**Nginx**:

```nginx
proxy_connect_timeout 5s;
proxy_send_timeout 60s;
proxy_read_timeout 60s;
send_timeout 60s;
```

Keep client/CDN timeouts slightly shorter.

---

### ✅ 2. Move Long Work to Background Jobs

```ruby
class ReportJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(user_id)
    user = User.find(user_id)
    ReportGenerator.generate_for(user)
  end
end

def create
  ReportJob.perform_later(current_user.id)
  render json: { status: "queued" }, status: :accepted
end
```

Return `202 Accepted` and let Sidekiq or Resque do the work.

---

### ✅ 3. Cache Expensive Reads

```ruby
def index
  @articles = Rails.cache.fetch("articles:index", expires_in: 10.minutes) do
    Article.includes(:author).order(created_at: :desc).limit(100).to_a
  end
  render json: @articles
end
```

Add `ETag` and `Cache-Control` headers for even better CDN caching.

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Improvements

### 🧠 1. Separate CPU vs IO Pools

**Procfile**

```bash
web_io: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.io.rb
web_cpu: bundle exec puma -C config/puma.cpu.rb
```

**Nginx routing**

```nginx
location /reports/ { proxy_pass http://app_cpu; proxy_read_timeout 180; }
location /api/     { proxy_pass http://app_io;  proxy_read_timeout 30;  }
```

CPU tasks won’t block I/O threads anymore.

---

### 🧠 2. Tune Connection Pools

Ensure DB pool ≥ Puma max threads:

```yaml
production:
  database:
    pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 8 } %>
```

---

### 🧠 3. Prewarm Caches

Warm caches during deploy:

```bash
curl -s https://example.com/api/popular?page=1 > /dev/null
```

---

### 🧠 4. Observability

```ruby
Rack::Timeout.service_timeout = 25
```

Monitor:

* p95/p99 latency
* 499 rate
* Puma thread saturation
* DB pool waits

## 🕹 Timeout Hierarchy (Balanced Setup)

| Layer                      | Example Timeout | Purpose              |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Client/CDN                 | 30s             | User patience        |
| Nginx `proxy_read_timeout` | 60s             | Buffer for app       |
| Rack::Timeout              | 25s             | Safety cutoff        |
| DB/HTTP client             | 10–20s          | Fail fast            |
| Puma `worker_timeout`      | 60s             | Detect stuck workers |

---

## ⚖️ Quick vs Long-Term Fixes

| Type      | Actions                                      | Goal               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Quick     | Align timeouts, cache, async jobs            | Stop 499s          |
| Mid-Term  | Split pools, prewarm, tune DB                | Boost reliability  |
| Long-Term | Add tracing, circuit breakers, load shedding | Prevent regression |

---

## 🧩 Final Checklist

✅ Track request IDs
✅ Fix slow DB queries
✅ Add timeouts for external calls
✅ Use caching smartly
✅ Offload heavy jobs
✅ Align timeout hierarchy
✅ Alert on 499s + latency

## 🏁 Conclusion

HTTP 499s aren’t bugs — they’re **signals**.
They show your system is slower than your user’s patience.

By caching smartly, tuning timeouts, and separating workloads, you’ll transform your Rails API from *fragile* to *formidable*.
