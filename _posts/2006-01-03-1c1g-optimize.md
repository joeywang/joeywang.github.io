Great idea 👍
I’ll treat this as **two publish-ready tech articles** you can post on a blog / Medium / dev.to.
Because these articles **contain shell commands**, I will **not** use writing blocks (per UI rules) and instead give you **clean Markdown-style content** with proper code blocks.

## How to Optimize an Ubuntu 1C1G Cloud Server (A Practical, Proven Guide)

### Introduction

Running a cloud server with **1 CPU and 1GB RAM** is common for personal projects, landing pages, and small websites.
However, **default Ubuntu installations are not optimized for such low-resource environments**, often leading to:

* High memory usage
* Random freezes
* OOM (Out of Memory) kills
* Poor performance under small traffic spikes

This article walks through **real, production-tested optimizations** to make Ubuntu **stable, predictable, and usable** on a 1C1G server.

---

## 1. The Core Principle: Reduce, Don’t Tune Blindly

On a 1C1G server, optimization is mostly about **removing unnecessary components**, not endless tuning.

Key rules:

* Fewer background services
* Fewer resident daemons
* Predictable memory usage
* Swap is mandatory

---

## 2. Enable Swap (Non-Negotiable)

Many cloud images ship **without swap**, which is dangerous on low memory machines.

```bash
sudo fallocate -l 512M /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Verify:

```bash
free -h
```

Why this matters:

* Prevents sudden OOM kills
* Absorbs short memory spikes
* Improves system stability dramatically

---

## 3. Adjust Kernel Memory Behavior

Reduce aggressive swapping and cache pressure:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-1c1g.conf <<EOF
vm.swappiness=10
vm.vfs_cache_pressure=200
vm.dirty_ratio=10
vm.dirty_background_ratio=5
EOF

sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-1c1g.conf
```

---

## 4. Install earlyoom (Fail Fast, Not Freeze)

Instead of letting the system hang:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y earlyoom
sudo systemctl enable --now earlyoom
```

This kills memory-hogging processes **before** the kernel panics.

---

## 5. Remove Ubuntu’s Server-Unfriendly Services

Ubuntu enables many services that are **useless on cloud servers**.

Disable them:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now \
  snapd \
  fwupd \
  multipathd \
  iscsid \
  packagekit \
  unattended-upgrades
```

Remove snap completely if unused:

```bash
sudo apt purge -y snapd
sudo rm -rf /snap /var/snap /var/lib/snapd /var/cache/snapd
```

Memory saved: **100–200MB**

---

## 6. Limit systemd Journal Size

Unbounded logs silently eat disk and memory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d

sudo tee /etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/limit.conf <<EOF
[Journal]
SystemMaxUse=50M
RuntimeMaxUse=20M
EOF

sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```

---

## 7. Optimize MySQL for Low Memory

MySQL is often the **largest memory consumer**.

Edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
```

Add under `[mysqld]`:

```ini
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 128M
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M
max_connections = 20
performance_schema = OFF
table_open_cache = 400
```

Restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

---

## 8. Tune PHP-FPM Conservatively

For PHP 8.x:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/php/8.3/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
```

Recommended settings:

```ini
pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 2
pm.start_servers = 1
pm.min_spare_servers = 1
pm.max_spare_servers = 1
```

---

## 9. What “Healthy” Looks Like

```bash
free -h
```

Expected:

* Available memory ≥ **450–550MB**
* Swap usage < **100MB**
* No frequent CPU spikes
* No OOM events

---

## Conclusion

A 1C1G Ubuntu server **can be perfectly stable** if treated correctly.

The key is not powerful hardware—but **intentional minimalism**.

## Building a Website on a 1C1G Server: Technology Choices, Pros & Cons

### Introduction

Once your 1C1G server is optimized, the next question is:

> **What website stack should I actually run on this thing?**

Not all web technologies are equal under resource constraints.
This article compares **popular website-building approaches**, focusing on **performance, maintainability, and suitability for low-end servers**.

---

## 1. Static Sites (Best Choice for 1C1G)

### Examples

* Hugo
* Astro (static output)
* Jekyll
* Hexo

### Pros

* No database
* No runtime backend
* Near-zero memory usage
* Extremely secure
* Handles traffic spikes easily

### Cons

* Content editing workflow may feel less “CMS-like”
* Requires rebuild to publish changes

### Best For

* Homepages
* Blogs
* Landing pages
* Documentation sites

---

## 2. Static Site + Visual Editor (Best Balance)

### Example

* **Publii + Nginx**

Architecture:

* Visual editor runs on your local machine
* Server only serves static files

### Pros

* True WYSIWYG editing
* Zero server-side processing
* Ideal for non-developers
* Almost no maintenance

### Cons

* Editing not done directly on server

### Verdict

👉 **The most practical solution for 1C1G servers**

---

## 3. Traditional CMS (WordPress)

### Pros

* Huge ecosystem
* Familiar admin interface
* Plugins for everything

### Cons

* PHP + MySQL memory overhead
* Security maintenance burden
* Poor performance without tuning

### Verdict

⚠️ Acceptable only with **strict optimization**
❌ Overkill for simple homepages

---

## 4. Headless CMS + Static Frontend

### Examples

* Hugo + Decap CMS
* Next.js static export + CMS

### Pros

* Online editing
* Clean separation of content & presentation
* Modern workflow

### Cons

* Setup complexity
* Git-based workflow may confuse non-technical users

---

## 5. Node.js CMS (Ghost, Strapi)

### Pros

* Modern interfaces
* API-driven

### Cons

* High memory usage
* Database dependency
* Poor fit for 1C1G

### Verdict

❌ Not recommended

---

## 6. Comparison Table

| Stack         | Memory Usage | Stability | Ease of Use | 1C1G Friendly |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Static (Hugo) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐         | ✅             |
| Publii        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ✅             |
| WordPress     | ⭐⭐           | ⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⚠️            |
| Headless CMS  | ⭐⭐⭐          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐      | ⭐⭐          | ⚠️            |
| Node CMS      | ⭐            | ⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐         | ❌             |

---

## Final Recommendation

For a **1C1G cloud server**:

> **Static-first architectures are not a compromise—they are the optimal design.**

If you need:

* Maximum stability → **Static site**
* Visual editing → **Publii**
* Dynamic features → **Carefully optimized WordPress**

---

If you want, next I can:

* Edit these into **Medium / dev.to formatting**
* Add **SEO titles & summaries**
* Turn them into a **series with diagrams**
* Localize them into Chinese or bilingual versions

Just tell me how you plan to publish them.
