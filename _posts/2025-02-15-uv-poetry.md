# Modern Python Project Management: Poetry vs. uv

Managing Python dependencies has evolved significantly over the years. In 2025, two tools stand out for modern workflows: **Poetry** and **uv**. This article compares both, explores their pros and cons, and outlines best practices for managing Python projects efficiently.

---

## What is Poetry?

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is an all-in-one tool for dependency management and packaging. It uses `pyproject.toml` to define and manage your project’s dependencies, metadata, and build instructions. It simplifies creating and publishing Python packages.

```bash
# Create a new project with Poetry
poetry new my_project
cd my_project

# Add a dependency
poetry add requests

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```


## What is uv?

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a next-generation Python package manager built by the creators of Ruff. It focuses on **speed**, **determinism**, and **compatibility** with `pyproject.toml`. While it doesn’t yet offer full package publishing, it’s blazing fast for installs and dependency resolution.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment with uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# or use Poetry lockfile directly
uv pip install -r poetry.lock
```

## Poetry vs. uv: Feature Comparison

| Feature                         | `uv`                                  | `poetry`                                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Dependency resolution          | Ultra-fast                             | Slower                                   |
| Lockfile support               | Yes (`poetry.lock`)                    | Yes                                      |
| Virtualenv management          | Yes (`uv venv`)                        | Yes (automatic)                          |
| Packaging and publishing       | No (planned)                           | Yes                                      |
| CLI simplicity                 | Minimal                                | Rich and descriptive                     |
| Editable installs              | Yes (`--editable`)                     | Yes                                      |
| Cross-platform support         | Yes                                    | Yes                                      |


## Pros and Cons

### Poetry
**Pros:**
- Full packaging and publishing support
- Clear CLI for managing dependencies
- Automatically handles virtual environments

**Cons:**
- Slower installs and resolution
- Can be heavyweight
- Complex projects may hit edge cases

### uv
**Pros:**
- Incredibly fast installs and resolution
- Compatible with existing pyproject.toml and poetry.lock
- Lightweight and simple to use

**Cons:**
- No publishing features yet
- Not ideal as a standalone tool for new projects
- Requires a separate tool (like Poetry or PDM) to define dependencies

## Best Practices for Dependency Management (2025 Edition)

1. **Use `pyproject.toml` as the single source of truth.**
   - Avoid requirements.txt if possible; use it only for CI builds.

2. **Use Poetry for dependency definition and publishing.**
   - Define your dependencies and build instructions using `poetry add` and `poetry build`.

3. **Use uv for fast installations and CI.**
   - Replace `poetry install` with `uv pip install -r poetry.lock` for blazing-fast installs.

4. **Always commit your lockfile.**
   - Ensures reproducibility across environments.

5. **Use `.venv` for local environments.**
   ```bash
   poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
   uv venv
   ```

6. **Don't mix tools.**
   - Avoid combining pip, poetry, conda, or manual editing.

7. **Use `uv` to validate install speed.**
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r poetry.lock  # Fast and deterministic
   ```

## Conclusion

Both Poetry and uv bring great advantages to modern Python workflows. Use Poetry when you need full project management, packaging, and publishing. Use uv when speed and minimalism are essential—especially in CI/CD.

**Best of both worlds?** Use Poetry to define, uv to install.
